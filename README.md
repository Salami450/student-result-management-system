# Student Result Management System

## Project Overview
This is a simple console-based Python application that allows users to manage student academic results efficiently. The program is designed to be user-friendly and includes input validation, multiple student entry, and average score calculation.

## Features
- Add one or more student records at a time
- Validate student name and score inputs
- View all students and their scores
- Automatically calculate and display average score
- Menu-driven console interface

## SDLC Summary
1. **Requirement Analysis:** Identify functional requirements: add students, view records, calculate average, input validation.
2. **System Design:** Console-based Python application using modular functions (`add_student()` and `view_students()`) and a dictionary for data storage.
3. **Implementation:** Implemented in Python (`main.py`) with functions for adding and viewing students.
4. **Testing:** Verified addition of multiple students, display of results, average calculation, and proper input validation.
5. **Deployment:** Run `main.py` on any Python-enabled environment. Menu-driven interface allows interaction through the terminal.
6. **Maintenance:** Future updates may include file storage, editing/deleting records, grade calculation, and report generation.
